auto:
    1) we have 2 distinct autos, clips and baskets
    2) clips - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGloUcDordU
        a) cycle times
            i) 3 seconds from pickup to dropoff
            ii) 3 seconds from dropoff to pickup
    3) baskets - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFzZbceNlLQ
        a) cycle times
            i) 3 seconds from pickup to dropoff
            ii) 3 seconds from dropoff to pickup
    3) we need to end either in the observation zone or a level 1 accent
    4) each human player starts with 2 yellows and 2 colored and each robot 
        can be preloaded with of these

tele:
    1) again 2 distinct roles, clips or baskets
    2) there are 15 red, 15 blue, and 30 yellow in the center
    3) basket is 8pts where clips are 10pts
    4) as of 1/28 our robot can effectively do baskets, not clips during tele (talk to Julian)

controller:
    1) work with Paul how we are going to setup
    2) 2 remotes?
